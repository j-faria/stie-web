I just discovered that Gnuplot can do conditional plotting, even on tabular data from a file. 
Check out |post|.

This just increases my admiration for this little tool. Granted, the plots may not look as nice as the ones from matplotlib (at
least not without considerable tweaking), but when you just need to quickly dive into the data to check for patterns nothing
beats Gnuplot.
