"Academic research is often driven by real passion, but by the time it turns into scholarly prose, the heat has long since dissipated. Writing with soul doesn't have to be personal, confessional, or raw, but it can't be pretentious or inflated. Most of the great essayists knew that a plain style didn't hurt. Sit down with Montaigne, Addison and Steele, Hazlitt, Goldsmith, Bacon, and Lamb and you'll feel like you're in a tavern or a book-lined private study, chatting with a smart, wise, and often witty friend. Academics learn to dress their ideas in bulletproof, jargon-ridden suits, to parry attacks before they are launched, to make small and careful points rather than allowing themselves to be vulnerable by pitching big and strange ideas in direct and forceful sentences. But that is not the path to making yourself compelling as a writer."
